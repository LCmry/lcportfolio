# People-Centered Improvement

**Hi, I’m Lauren. I design clear processes that help teams work better together.**
I specialize in people-centered process development, project coordination, and operational improvement.
Whether I’m guiding teams through change, simplifying complex workflows, or building structure where it’s needed most, my focus is always on clarity, communication, and continuous learning.
