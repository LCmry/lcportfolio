I’m a project manager and consultant with a background in engineering management,
anthropology, and computer science. I help teams navigate complexity by creating clear
systems, communication structures, and actionable plans.

My experience includes:

- Leading distributed engineering teams through organizational change
- Designing onboarding systems and communication frameworks for high-growth teams
- Improving operational clarity for construction and service businesses
- Supporting clients in achieving customer-centered quality certifications

I enjoy turning messy, ambiguous situations into calm, structured, and sustainable systems.
